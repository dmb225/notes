[Hidden Tools](https://hiddentools.dev/)
A single-page website that consists of a pool of valuable tools contributed by their community. You can find almost any tool you need here regardless of your project, to help make it more efficient and faster.
This website does not limit itself to a list of development tools but also tools that are helpful for productivity and writing stories.
A brilliant tool I came across was ray.so from the featured tools in Hidden Tools. It allows beautifying code snippets to add-on to your stories.
You should check it out too!
